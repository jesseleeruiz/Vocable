## Background 😃
I built and designed this app from scratch during a 1 week build sprint at Lambda School. My iOS instructor challenged us to make something that would benefit someone you know personally. My inspiration was making something for my brother in law. He is a freelance muscisian and event coordinator who has a lot of meetings with a lot of people. I wondered, "What if he had an app where he could record his meetings with people on the fly, edit it right then and there, and send it off to them as a PDF so they were on the same page"? Thus, Vocable was born.
